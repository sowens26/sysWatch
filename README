>SYSWATCH aims to provide a tool for monitoring the activity on a particular machine
>it creates an sqlite database of all activity on the machine
>each record represents a change in the current "focused" window
>each record contains information on the start and end time of the window session
>as well as  a full log of key presses, mouse clicks, and mouse scrolls
>this activity record is paired with a facial recognition system 
>the face of the active user is compared against a facial recognition model
>authorized users will take pictures of themselves using the machines designated camera
>these images are used to train the recognition model

>currently, if the face is not one of the authorized users the record will show UNKNOWN USER
>if the face is one of the authorized user that user's name will be added to the sql record
>a single record may have more than one active user if multiple authorized users are detected during a sessions
